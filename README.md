`Refit` is a powerful REST client library for .NET, which simplifies the process of making HTTP requests by allowing developers to define API endpoints using interfaces. With Refit, you don't need to manually handle serialization, HTTP clients, or constructing requests. Instead, you define your REST API endpoints as C# interfaces, and Refit automatically generates the underlying implementation for you.

### Key Features of Refit:

- Strongly Typed Interfaces: Define HTTP endpoints with methods and attributes, and Refit generates the code to call these endpoints.

- Minimal Boilerplate: No need to manually write code for making HTTP requests, handling query parameters, or serializing/deserializing data.

- Declarative and Simple: Just annotate methods with HTTP verbs like [Get], [Post], [Put], etc., and Refit takes care of the rest.

- Integration with Dependency Injection: Easily integrates with .NET Dependency Injection for cleaner code and scalability.

- In this project, Refit is used to interact with an external API (JSONPlaceholder) to handle blog posts, making API interaction seamless and easy.
